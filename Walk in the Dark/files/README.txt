"Walk in the Dark" is an interactive experience I created to help you step into the world of blind and visually impaired individuals. Through choice-driven scenarios—like crossing a busy street, ordering coffee, or navigating a job interview—you'll face the challenges they encounter daily and gain a deeper understanding of their resilience, adaptability, and the barriers they overcome. Along the way, I share facts and perspectives to challenge misconceptions about blindness, showing that vision is about more than sight—it’s about understanding, access, and empowerment. By the end of your journey, I hope you’ll reflect on how we can make the world more inclusive and accessible. Are you ready to see the world differently?
