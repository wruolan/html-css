          Outside, the sky is a muted gray, a bit darker than it should be this
          early in the evening. The news had warned of a storm, something about
          scattered rain and possibly thunder tonight, but this feels different,
          heavier.
          <br /><br />
          The air feels still. Unnervingly so.
          <br /><br />
          You shake off the unease. There’s work to finish, after all, and a bit
          of quiet anxiety won’t change that. But the clock’s ticking feels
          louder than it should, each second a relentless reminder that time is
          passing, and it feels, somehow, like it’s running out.
