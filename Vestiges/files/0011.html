          You glance at your phone again. Five minutes have passed, and you’re
          no closer to being finished with the last few logs. With a sigh, you
          save your progress, close the browser, and shut down your computer,
          the monitor fading to black as the soft hum of machinery dissipates
          into the stillness of the room.
          <br /><br />
          An odd feeling sits at the pit of your stomach, something thick and
          cold. Anxiety, maybe—the kind you help others process daily but rarely
          allow yourself to acknowledge.
          <br /><br />
          Just as you begin to push the unease aside, your phone buzzes on the
          desk, jolting you from your thoughts.
