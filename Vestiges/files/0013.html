          You gather your things and exit your office, locking the door behind
          you, the click echoing in the quiet hallway. Cynthia, your
          receptionist, glances up from her desk when you enter the waiting
          room, her face brightening with a smile.
          <br /><br />
          “Hey. Long day?”
          <br /><br />
          “Just the usual. How about you?”
          <br /><br />
          “You know me, always busy, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
          <br /><br />
          After a few more minutes of light banter, she heads out, and you turn
          back to lock up. You give the area a once-over before locking the
          front door, making sure all the lights are off and that you haven’t
          left anything behind. Satisfied, you step out into the dimming light
          of evening, the cool air a welcome change as you finally leave the day
          behind.
