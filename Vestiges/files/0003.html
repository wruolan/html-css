          You blink to clear your vision and check the time on your phone: 5:41
          PM. Just nineteen minutes until you can officially close up for the
          day. <br /><br />
          You’d been uploading patient logs to the clinic’s new medical
          database, an agonizingly slow process. Despite your best intentions,
          it looks like your body gave out on you, sneaking in a nap you hadn’t
          planned for. You roll your shoulders, sore from the awkward angle
          you’d been slouched in, and let your gaze wander around the small
          office. Your own private practice. Just a few months in, and you’re
          already run ragged.
