In this demo, you play as a therapist navigating an unsettling world as mysterious nuclear detonations devastate the city, leaving behind a chilling black fire that consumes everything. Each decision you make influences your fate as you attempt to return home, but every day seem to end in tragedy. Use sticky notes and patient logs from your previous attempts to uncover clues, survive longer, and learn about the impending doom you face.

This project is based on a plot bunny for a fanfiction I’ve been putting on hold for a while. It gave me a chance to expand on the plot and worldbuilding, which I'm thankful for — made the process more interesting. I’ll probably create more content when I have the time, since I’ve worked out most of the kinks in the CSS.
